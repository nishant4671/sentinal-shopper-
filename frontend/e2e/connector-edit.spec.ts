/**
 * Connector detail + Edit (P5 slice 3 — PR-F5).
 *
 * Pre-PR-F5 the ConnectorDetail page existed but was unreachable from
 * the list view — users had to type the URL by hand. PR-F5 adds an
 * Edit button on every connector card that navigates to
 * `/dashboard/connectors/<id>` and opens the edit form.
 *
 * This spec asserts:
 *  1. Each connector card renders an Edit button.
 *  2. Clicking it lands on the detail page with the connector's name.
 *  3. The detail page shows the auth-type field (prerequisite for the
 *     OAuth/secret edit flow).
 *
 * Drift guard: regressing the route or removing the Edit button will
 * fail the assertions here instead of being discovered by a customer.
